An indicator will be on screen telling you when the grenade is about to explode, you have 3 seconds.
It's inspired by Call of Duty 3, while the smoke trail that spawns from the grenade is inspired by Black Mesa.
- Plasma Rifle has an alt fire, a very fast fire for normal, and a new alternate mode, heated plasma rounds. Heated Plasma Rounds alt fire is more inspired by the heat blast from Doom Eternal

- New special modes, Burst mode for SMG (will likely move this to the pistol and SMG will have a 5 round burst), and semi-auto mode for the Combat Rifle)
